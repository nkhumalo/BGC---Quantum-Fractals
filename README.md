# BGC---Quantum-Fractals

In this workshop,  students will explore the complexity of quantum computing and how it is used in the world around them. They will consider some of the benefits and drawbacks of quantum computers compared to the computers we have today. They will also use the IBM Circuit Composer to build quantum circuits and create fractal art. The lesson plan and powerpoint necessary to teach students basic quantum computing concepts live in this repository

In this activity,  you will be required to lead students through a Jupyter notebook to create fractal art. You do not need detailed knowledge of Qiskit or fractals, and all necessary code is already written. Students just need to edit the quantum circuits to their liking. Special thanks to Black Girls Code and Dr. Wiktor Mazin for his beautiful fractal art!
